The Swiss Coordinate System
The goal of this Tutorial is that we can work with geodata form the Federal Statistics Office. The keyword you google for is “Generalisierte Gemeindegrenzen”.
You will land on this download page where you can choose for what year you want to download the data.

Why is the year important?
…you might ask yourself. Let me tell you: it’s very, very important. Borders are constantly changing – mainly because small municipalities choose to go together with their neighbors – they merge. This happens several times a year!

👉🏼 If you have data that you want to display, you’ll need to find out with the exact status of municipalities it contains.
This is usually specified in the metadata of a dataset. If it’s not, you’ll need to compare the number of municipalities in the dataset and in the different shapefiles.

In the folder you downloaded you find usually find two folders, e.g. ggg_2017 and ggg_2017vz. VZ stands for “Volkszählung” (census) and means, the data is from the 31st of December of that year.
The other folder contains data for the 1st of January. Within that folder, you navigate to /shp/LV95/. In there you’ll find groups of files (.cpg, .dbf, .prj, .shp and .shx).
If you move these files around always take all 5 of them. If you rename them, rename all – they must always have the same name as they are interlinked.

z.B. ag-b-00.03-875-gg20.zip\ggg_2020-LV95\shp

The files starting with “g1” are more detailed (more fine-grained borders) that those with “g2”. The third letter indicates what kind of borders the file contains:

g = Gemeinde (municipality)
b = Bezirke (districts)
k = Kanton (canton)
l = Land (country)
s = Seen (lakes)

We want to show Gemeinden (municipalities) at the state of the 31st of December and we don’t need it in the most detailed form. g2g17.shp is this what we need.

These are Swiss Coordinates (sometimes also called CH1903+, LV95 or EPSG:2056). What’s cool: 1 unit is equal to 1 meter.
You may have only worked with what you might call “GPS Data”, where you have lat and a long that look something like 46.8066834, 6.7238481.

In Switzerland, the numbers are called north and east or sometimes just Y and X (yes, actually in that order, as you can read on Wikipedia).

Ok, we have the map that we want. But now we need to bring this shapefile into a format that browser understands better:
